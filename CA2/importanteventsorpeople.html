                <p>My paternal grandmother was a very important person in my early childhood.</p>
                <p>She used to live with us and helped to do most of the housework and cooking.</p>

                <h2>An important event that impacted my life</h2>
                <p>So this is my personal story</p>
                <p>
                    When I was in primary two, one incident happened that made me change to become a completely different person for the worse.
                    One day, the teacher was returning us our exercise books and for some reason my book was misplaced, and
                    I did not receive my book. After that, the teacher was searching high and low all around the class for
                    my book. Meanwhile, the rest of the class was shouting some random stuff across the room like &#34;Maybe
                    the teacher is hiding it somewhere&#34;, &#34;Maybe the teacher is...&#34; So, I decided to join in because
                    it seems okay that others are saying that. And I said &#34;Maybe the teacher is lying&#34;.... &#34;Who
                    said that?&#34; she asked in a threatening tone. The atmosphere changed, the students were dead silent
                    and they all pointed at me. The teacher finally found the book in a cabinet and went to the desk at the
                    front of the class and she commanded me to step forward. &#34;Why did you say I was lying?&#34; she roared.
                    I stood there petrified with fear with beads of tears rolling down my cheeks. I was speechless and stunned.
                    From that day on, I tried so hard to suppress my feelings and just numbed my heart. I cry myself to sleep
                    every night. I was so afraid to come to school and I was afraid of saying anything ever again in a fear
                    that I might hurt someone and that I might get punished for speaking. I changed from a person that was
                    happy and cheerful to one with a heart of stone and fearful. Since that incident, I became a depressed
                    and quiet and reserved person who overthinks everything. I would drag my feet to school every day and
                    the floor would be the most beautiful thing I see while walking. I was just living one day at a time
                    hoping and waiting that someday, something will happen. This happens for the whole rest of my primary
                    school life up to secondary three. No one bothered to ask me how I was. NO ONE IN THIS WORLD GAVE EVEN
                    HALF A CRAP. My parents made matters worse by scolding me for who I became. No one bothered to try to
                    understand me and love me. I did badly for PSLE. Contemplated suicide. Did not have any hope or meaning
                    in this life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That was until secondary three where I met this girl from my class. She was the most beautiful person that my eyes had laid
                    on. We talked, we laughed. One day, she told me she loved me. That was the first time anyone said that
                    they loved me. I felt an overwhelming sense of warmth. The entire world stops. Suddenly everything that
                    ever caused me pain fades away and I am filled with a feeling of delirium. The universe around seems
                    to explode with happiness. I just could not help myself but fall in love with her. I just couldn't stop
                    thinking about her. I was able to regain my confidence and get back on my feet.

                    However, that lasted for... what? Three months? I soon found out that she says &#34;I love you&#34; to everyone in the class.
                    I was so heartbroken and confused. I thought I was special. I thought that for once somebody loved me,
                    that somebody wanted me. Sadly, I was wrong. I wasted all my feelings and effort trying to love her back.
                    Long story short, we just remained as &#34;just friends&#34;. Nonetheless, I was still baffled by the
                    fact that I even exist in people's lives, that not everyone is evil and that there is still good and
                    love in this world and that I was deserving of love. I know I wasn't ready to give up on love just yet.
